# Project Overview
This project focuses on data cleaning and preparation using MySQL to transform a global layoffs dataset into a clean and usable format for further exploratory data analysis (EDA). The cleaned data lays the foundation for uncovering trends and insights about layoffs across various industries and companies.

**Key Highlights**
📊 Data Cleaning: The project involved transforming a raw dataset into a structured format, ready for analysis.
🔄 Step-by-Step Cleaning: Tasks included removing duplicates, standardizing data, handling null and blank values, and updating data types to ensure consistency and accuracy.
📝 Staging Table: A staging table was created to safely apply transformations, preserving the raw data for reference and minimizing risk.
🔄 Handling Nulls & Duplicates: Efficient methods were used to manage missing values and duplicates, enhancing the data’s integrity.
📅 Date Formatting: Converted the date column into a proper date format to enable time series analysis and deeper insights into trends.
🔗 Data Standardization: Standardized key fields like industry names (e.g., "cryptocurrency" variants) for accurate grouping in analysis.

**Insights and Findings**
🔍 Data Integrity: Addressing issues like nulls, blanks, and duplicates ensured that the dataset was reliable for future exploration.
📉 Layoff Data Preparation: Transformations were applied to key columns such as company, industry, and total layoffs, ensuring data accuracy for further analysis.
📊 SQL Expertise: Advanced SQL techniques like CTEs, partitioning, and row numbering were employed to handle complex data cleaning tasks efficiently.


# EDA-on-layoffs-in-companies
This project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) using a dataset to uncover insights about layoffs in various companies.

**Highlights**

📊 Clean Dataset: The project builds on a previously cleaned dataset for effective exploration.
🔍 EDA Process: The analysis aims to uncover insights without a fixed agenda, exploring various aspects of the data.
📈 Max Layoffs: Notable findings include companies with maximum layoffs, such as 12,000 in a single instance.
🏢 Industry Impact: Consumer and retail sectors faced significant layoffs, likely due to COVID-19 effects.
🌍 Country Comparison: The U.S. reported the highest layoffs, followed by India and several European countries.
📅 Yearly Trends: The analysis shows a dramatic increase in layoffs from 2020 to 2023, particularly in 2022.
📉 Company Stages: Most layoffs occurred in post-IPO companies, indicating vulnerability among larger firms.

**Key Insights**

🔎 Data Exploration: The EDA process combines exploration and cleaning, revealing hidden patterns and issues within the dataset.
📉 Layoff Trends: The staggering total of layoffs over three years highlights economic challenges, particularly in tech and consumer sectors.
💼 Major Players: Companies like Amazon, Google, and Meta led in layoffs, underscoring industry shifts during economic downturns.
🏙️ Geographic Disparity: The U.S. experienced the most layoffs, reflecting its significant role in the global economy and the tech industry.
📊 Data Visualization: Rolling totals and groupings by year provide clearer trends, essential for understanding layoff patterns over time.
🏢 Company Stages: The analysis of company stages reveals how funding rounds correlate with layoffs, providing insights into financial health.


This project demonstrates essential skills in data cleaning, MySQL proficiency, and preparation for EDA. By handling real-world issues such as data integrity, formatting, and standardization, this project showcases expertise in preparing datasets for meaningful analysis, making it an excellent addition to a data analysis portfolio.
